I love learning about new ML concepts, making fun projects and I usually get sidetracked ricing my Arch Linux (btw) setup. 

I currently work as a Data Science Intern at MineSense and TA CPSC213 (Intro to Systems) at UBC. 

To look through my experiences and skills hop on by www.joelexia.net (and have a really fun time using a shell to go through my work!) or email me at **contact [at] joelexia [dot] net**.

Have a look at my projects below!! (âœ¿â— â€¿â— )
